/*
Difference between `type` and `interface` in TypeScript:

1. Syntax:
   - interface: uses `interface` keyword
   - type: uses `type` keyword

2. Extension:
   - interface: extendable using `extends`
   - type: extendable using intersection (`&`)

3. Declaration Merging:
   - interface: can be declared multiple times (they merge)
   - type: cannot be redeclared (gives error)

4. Usage Scope:
   - interface: best for defining object shapes and class contracts
   - type: more powerful â†’ can define unions, intersections, tuples, primitives, etc.

5. Class Implements:
   - Both `type` and `interface` can be used with `implements`

6. Advanced Types:
   - interface: cannot directly represent union/tuple types
   - type: can represent unions, intersections, tuples, and primitive aliases

7. Convention:
   - Use `interface` for object structures
   - Use `type` for unions, primitives, and complex compositions
